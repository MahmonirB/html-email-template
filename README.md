### You need to remember that email design is very different to website design.


> You need to ignore all usual standards, you need to use tables, inline styles, img tags etc.

__________________________________________________________________

**There are some important points that should be pay attention to it:**

  - Use HTML *Tables* for Layout
  
  - Add CSS Styles, actually use *inline-style* and do not use the CSS style declaration in the HTML head tag, as you might when authoring web pages.
  
  - Avoid using JavaScript. Most email software will disable it anyway.
  
  -  Avoid using float in css rules and using flexbox to make it responsive.
  
  - It is better to use base64 code jpeg images. 
  
  - **Test, test, test**
Finally, it is important to always test your emails on a variety of email clients. And be sure to test continuously, as features and support can change at any time!

## Optional for test via gmail
